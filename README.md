# fse-100-fan
for my first fse 100 project, we had to make a fan that changed behavior according to the temperature

in the code, the variables that set the temp thresholds and the code that converts the units are there and easily accessible. the reason why there isn't any user input anywhere is that the LCD screen takes up like, 9-ish pins, so i literally ran out of pins to add an IR sensor for a remote or a Bluetooth connecter or even a button because i only had an arduino uno to work with

### the components of the fan  
motor for the actual fan  
servo for rotating the neck(?) of the fan  
LCD screen to indicate temperature and unit  
temperature sensor  
a red LED to indicate if the temp is too high  
a green LED to indicate if the temp is below the set threshold
a buzzer that plays a short small sound when the temp is too high
